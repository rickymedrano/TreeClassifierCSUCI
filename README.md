This was the final project for COMP546 Pattern Recognition where we were tasked to classify objects of interest. I decided attempting to differentiate between California Sycamore, California Pepper Tree, and Jacaranda would be a good project. I made it more interesting by only looking at bark when attempting classification. Traditionally leaves are used but bark presented a good problem to solve. 

This project was coded in MATLAB. 

## Getting Started

Clone the repository to your computer. 

### Prerequisites

This code was tested on MATLAB 2019a and 2019b. You will also need the Deep Learning, Statistics & Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Image Processing toolboxes. You will also need to download AlexNet from the Add-Ons.

```
Give examples
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### Keywords

Machine Learning, Transfer Learning, Pattern Recognition, Image Processing, Feature Extract, HOG Features, SURF Features, Multi-Class SVM, Image Datastore, Classifier, Image Classification, Bark
